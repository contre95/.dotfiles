# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute firstly!

If you have an idea for a feature or can see something that needs improvement,
please open an issue before you start development, this way we can make sure
that your goals are aligned with the goals of the project and that no
development effort is wasted.

There's not much more to it than that, so [open a new
issue](https://github.com/vimist/xtmon/issues/new) and let me know your ideas!
:)
